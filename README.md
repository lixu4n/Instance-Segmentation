# Instance Segmentation & Extraction using GrabCut Algorithm

## Using GrabCut Algorithm 

This simple program explores the GrabCut algorithm, an algorithm for foreground extraction with minimal user interaction. We also used ROI, Region of Interest which is a form of hardcoding, 
where we can apply certains filters, operations or algorithms on a selected subset of an image.
